# BorrowBase

# Hi, I am happy to announce this CLI based application BorrowBase is ready to use. It's a first release so may contain some bugs but don't worry I will be fixing them soon.!

## This is a project of management system of Customer and Shopkeeper. Whenever a consumer borrow money from shopkeeper (also known as Hisaab in Hindi) then instead of writing that on a notebook (which is done by almost all shopkeepers) they can use this software.
## This will reduce time and will make things easier.

## Developer Notes:
### > It is made on the concepts of OOPS by using JAVA v11.0.5
### > It will work on localhost ( 127.0.0.1 ).
### > It uses JDBC and My-SQL for Databse connectivity.
### > The Project is missing the SQL file ( and option for creating database ) however you can run the commands listed in the file.


## Prerequisites:
### > Make sure you have installed phpmyadmin ( or have installed My-SQL and Localhost server ) then you only have to run the commands which are in the file "BorrowBaseDB.sql".
### > Make sure you have installed Java compiler ( it is recommended to have v11 or higher ).


## Notes for First use:
