# BorrowBase

# Hi, I am happy to announce this CLI based application BorrowBase is ready to use. It's a first release so may contain some bugs but don't worry I will be fixing them soon.!

## This is a project of management system of Customer and Shopkeeper. Whenever a consumer borrow money from shopkeeper (also known as Hisaab in Hindi) then instead of writing that on a notebook (which is done by almost all shopkeepers) they can use this software.
## This will reduce time and will make things easier.

## Developer Notes:
### > It is going to be done on the concepts of OOPS by using JAVA v11.0.5
### > It will work on localhost (127.0.0.1 ).
### > It uses JDBC and My-SQL for Databse connectivity.
### > The Project is missing the SQL file ( and option for creating database ) however you can run the commands listed in the file.


## Prerequisites:
### > Make sure you have installed phpmyadmin ( or have installed My-SQL and Localhost server ) then you only have to run the commands which are in the file "BorrowBaseDB.sql".
### > Make sure you have installed Java compiler ( it is recommended to have v11 or higher ).


## Notes for First use:
### > Clone this repository ( or download zip file and unzip it ).
### > Reach to the directory in command promt or Terminal ( usually home/Downloads directory ) and run command `javac src/MainClassPackage/BorrowBaseMain.java` and then `java src/MainClassPackage/BorrowBaseMain`
### > Congratulations! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 You are now ready to use BorrowBase.
