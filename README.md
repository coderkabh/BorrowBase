# BorrowBase

## This is a project of management system of Customer and Shopkeeper. Whenever a consumer borrow money from shopkeeper (also known as Hisaab in Hindi) then instead of writing that on a notebook (which is done by almost all shopkeepers) they can use this software.
## This will reduce time and will make things easier.

## Developer Notes:
## > It is going to be done on the concepts of OOPS by using JAVA v11.0.5
## > It will work on localhost (127.0.0.1 ).
## > It uses JDBC and My-SQL for Databse connectivity.
